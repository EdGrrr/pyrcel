Parcel Model documentation
==================================

This documentation is automatically generated based on comments in the adiabatic
parcel model's code; it should be used as a quick-start guide to understanding how
the model is constructed and how it can be extended and modified for future research
purposes.

It is anticipated that this model will grow into a flexible and useful research tool
so.
