Adiabatic cloud parcel model
============================

Overview
--------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

This is an implementation of a simple, 0D adiabatic cloud parcel model tool which should be useful for studying aerosol/droplet activation. To support this, the tool ships with implementations of several well-known activation parameterizations from the literature, and tools for evaluating those schemes against the detailed model. 

You can find a quick overview of the model in the :ref:`model introduction <introduction>`. Eventually, there will be an :ref:`example library <library>` highlighting some simple, common experiments one could perform with this code. Also, there is a :ref:`reference <reference>` section for the various schemes and supporting tools implemented here.

Please, feel free to check out this model's `github repository <https://github.com/darothen/parcel_model>`_. You are invited to use the model (in accordance with the `licensing <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darothen/parcel_model/master/LICENSE>`_) as long as you get in touch with the author via `e-mail <mailto:darothen@mit.edu>`_ or on `twitter <https://twitter.com/darothen>`_
